Once upon a time, upon a lily-pad in the middle of a sparkling pond, there lived a large, green frog.
One hot summer's day, a princess set sail across the pond. As she glided past the lily-pad, the frog raised his head and called to her.

"Kiss me," said the frog, "upon my forehead, and I will turn into a handsome prince."

"Not likely," replied the princess, wrinkling her nose, "I rule my own kingdom, I lead my own armies into battle, I make my own laws. I need no prince, handsome or otherwise. What else do you have to offer?"

"Kiss me," said the frog, "upon my forehead, and I will grant you great fortunes."

"I think not," snorted the princess. "I maintain a balanced budget with good economic growth and sensible interest rates. Your great riches will devalue my currency, send inflation soaring and cripple our exchange rates. Is that the best you have to offer?"

"Kiss me," said the frog, "upon my forehead, and I will grant you dazzling beauty."

"How very flattering," sneered the princess. "I may be plain but beauty does not last. Personality counts."

"What do you want then?" demanded the frog, used to altogether more old-fashioned princesses.

The princess thought hard, and leaned close.

"I want to be happy," she whispered, and kissed the frog upon his forehead.

"You refused love, riches, beauty, and yet you want happiness from kissing a frog! This isn't a fairy tale you know," laughed the frog, diving clean into the clear, blue pond.
